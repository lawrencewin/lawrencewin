### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he / him

I'm a computer science major studying at UT Austin. I graduate in Spring 2022.
I'm currently working at the Austin Technology Incubator, and I've interned at Verizon in the past.
My best project is the Pannavasa Meditation Center's website right [here](https://www.pmcusa.org).
